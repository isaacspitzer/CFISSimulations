Software designed to create simulated CFIS observations.

Configure runs by editing Scripts/Variables.cfg, then run Scripts/MasterScript.py to generate the simulated observations.  The output will be placed in Runs/<Date-Time-of-Run>.  A copy of the Variables.cfg script used for that run will be stored in this folder as well.
